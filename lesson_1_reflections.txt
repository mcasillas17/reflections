-How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can access previous versions of your code and restore features that maybe were erased.

-What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A bigger history of changes when it's automatically saved.

-Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git works on a project and other systems work on separate files.

-How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Check differences between versions of the same file using the log history

-How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
When a change that breaks the code is introduced you can checkout to a previous version when the project was working.
